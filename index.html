            <h1>Welcome to my site!</h1>
            <p>
                I am currently learning both intermediate HTML and CSS on
                <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/profiles/CozyCable">Codecademy</a>.
                As such this site will be a constant WIP until I have completed the courses
                needed and established a solid foundation for this portfolio.
